So if you've been wondering why I haven't updated this repo for a week and a half. It's because I have been dealing with problems like not being able to access or read from a global var, and at first, I thought that this problem was because of Watcom being a broken ass compiler and because of that, I ended up wasting a week of my life trying to find other good compilers and I found a compiler called IA16-gcc and I heard that it's a very good compiler for 16bit OSDEV but the problem was that I need to install Linux to be able to use it and I did but

One day. I was scrolling through 16-Bit OS's on Github and I was lucky enough to find this OS https://github.com/barborik/graphOS that uses Watcom and IS 16BIT, I FINALLY FOUND A SOLUTION TO THIS FUCKING PROBLEM BECAUSE OF IT AND WHAT'S GOOD IS THAT I DON'T NEED TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT COMPILER. So I tried to apply the way GraphOS gets compiled and MY KERNEL WORKS WELL NOW

Despite the problems, I have made some progress like implementing STDIO and I will soon commit the changes today or tomorrow.
